**Pulp Plugin API**

The Pulp Plugin API is an essential part of the `Pulp Project 3.0+  <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pulpcore/>`__ which provides a set of base
classes that can be implemented in plugins to manage content in a way that is consistent 
across plugins, while still allowing plugin writers the freedom to define their workflows
as they deem necessary.

The Pulp Plugin API allows plugin writers:
 - to easily define your content types, and CRUD operations for all the base parts,
 - to use high-performance asynchronous download machinery,
 - to use tasking system,
 - and more.

See `Plugin Writer's Guide <https://docs.pulpproject.org/en/pulpcore-plugin/nightly/plugin-writer/>`__ for more information.


Pulp is completely free and open-source!
